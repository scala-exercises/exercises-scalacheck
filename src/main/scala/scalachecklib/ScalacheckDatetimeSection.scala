  /**
   * ==Usage==
   *
   * To arbitrarily generate dates and times, you need to have the `Arbitrary` in scope for your date/time class.
   * Assuming Joda Time:
   */
  def usage(res0: Boolean) = {

    import com.fortysevendeg.scalacheck.datetime.joda.ArbitraryJoda._
    import org.joda.time.DateTime
    import org.scalacheck.Prop.forAll

  /**
   * ==A note on imports==
   *
   * For all of the examples given in this document, you can substitute `jdk8` for `joda` and vice-versa,
   * depending on which library you would like to generate instances for.
   *
   * ==Implementation==
   *
   * The infrastructure behind the generation of date/time instances for any given date/time library,
   * which may take ranges into account, is done using a fairly simple typeclass, which has the type signature
   * `ScalaCheckDateTimeInfra[D, R]`. That is to say, as long as there is an implicit `ScalaCheckDateTimeInfra`
   * instance in scope for a given date/time type `D` (such as Joda’s `DateTime`) and a range type `R`
   * (such as Joda’s `Period`), then the code will compile and be able to provide generated date/time instances.
   *
   * As stated, currently there are two instances, `ScalaCheckDateTimeInfra[DateTime, Period]` for Joda Time and
   * `ScalaCheckDateTimeInfra[ZonedDateTime, Duration]` for Java SE 8’s Date and Time.
   *
   * ==Granularity==
   *
   * If you wish to restrict the precision of the generated instances, this library refers to that as <i>granularity</i>.
   *
   * You can constrain the granularity to:
   *
   * <ul>
   *  <li>Seconds</li>
   *  <li>Minutes</li>
   *  <li>Hours</li>
   *  <li>Days</li>
   *  <li>Years</li>
   * </ul>
   *
   *  When a value is constrained, the time fields are set to zero, and the rest to the first day of the month,
   *  or day of the year. For example, if you constrain a field to be years, the generated instance will be midnight
   *  exactly, on the first day of January.
   *
   *  To constrain a generated type, you simply need to provide an import for the typeclass for your date/time and
   *  range, and also an import for the granularity. As an example, this time using Java SE 8's `java.time` package:

   * new date/time instances, and a range for the generated instances.
   *
   * If the range is positive, it will be in the future from the base date/time, negative in the past.
